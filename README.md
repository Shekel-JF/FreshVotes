FreshVotes is a web application designed for users to share their ideas with various product owners. Users can create feature requests on the product's page, which can be voted for or against and commented on by other users.
Every user has the ability to become a product owner and change the status of each received feature request, informing others whether the feature was accepted or not.

The FreshVotes app was written using Java 19 and Spring Boot 3. For the frontend, I utilized Bootstrap 5.
